The account structure of **EMIT Wallet** is compatible with Ethereum, so accounts created directly from EMIT Wallet can be imported into other Ethereum-supported wallets with private keys or mnemonic words, and the private keys or mnemonic words of other Ethereum wallets can also be imported into EMIT Wallet. The following section describes how to create an account directly on EMIT Wallet and uses Metamask as an example to illustrate how to import third-party wallet accounts into EMIT Wallet.

## 3.1. Create with EMIT Wallet

### A. Slide the welcome page continuously to the last page and click "Getting Started".

The `Password Hint` option allows you to fill in hints to help you recall your password.

The `Wallet Password` will be used to encrypt the next generated mnemonic words locally and will not be uploaded to the network in any form.

### C. Back up the mnemonic phrase and click on `Confirmed Backup`.

**Security Tip:**
EMIT Wallet is a decentralized client and your account keys are stored locally and not uploaded to any servers.

The mnemonic words represent the full access to your account and there is no way to recover your account if you lose it, so be sure to write it down and keep it safe.

Anyone who has your mnemonic words will have full access to your account, so it is important that you do not write them down in an environment where they can be seen by others or captured by video equipment.

It cannot be transmitted over the network as a picture or text, because you do not know if the transmission you are using has adequate security and privacy.

### D. Select the correct order according to the backup mnemonic words and click "Confirm".

EMIT Wallet will generate sub-accounts for you for all blockchain systems that support EMIT CROSS and associate them with your private key.

The current account system is Ethereum compatible, if the same mnemonic words is imported to other Ethereum wallets, you will see the same ETH public key address.

### F. Exporting mnemonic words or Private Key
